# Student-Attendance-Tracker
A simple student attendance tracker for a class in college. There are two roles, Tutor and Student, each with their own login and profile home pages. The data is stored in a MySQL localhost database with tables that are imported from csv files.
The application accommodates separate features for the student and the tutor. 
•	Upon entering the required username and passcode in the student login, the student will be able to access their attendance records for the desired month and course.
•	Upon entering the correct username and passcode in the tutor login, the tutor will be able to view, and if necessary, edit the specific student’s attendance record in any desired subject for any desired month.
